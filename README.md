## Dataset Information

The `diamonds.csv` dataset contains the following attributes related to diamonds:

- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **Color**: Diamond color, with D being the best
- **Clarity**: Diamond clarity (I1, SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF)
- **Price**: Price in USD
- **X, Y, Z**: Length, width, and depth of the diamond

This dataset is used to explore relationships between various features and to create meaningful visualizations.
